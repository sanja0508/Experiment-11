# Experiment-11

Aim: To understand and implement the concept of Classes and Objects in C++ through practical examples.

Software Required: Visual Studio / Code::Blocks / Dev C++ / Turbo C++, C++ Compiler (GCC or MSVC)

Theory : When we write programs in C++, we often deal with data—numbers, strings, and all sorts of values. But as our programs grow, we need better ways to organize that data and the actions we perform on it. That’s where classes and objects come in.

Think of a class like a recipe. It tells you what ingredients (data) you need and what steps (functions) to follow. But the recipe itself doesn’t make food—you need to use it to create a dish. That dish is your object. It’s a real, usable version of the class. In this experiment, we explore how to build and use classes in C++. We start with simple examples: a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide; a car with a name, color, and year; a rectangle that knows how to calculate its area; and a student with academic details. Each of these examples shows how we can bundle related information and behavior into one neat package. Once we define a class, we can create multiple objects from it—each with its own unique data. For instance, two student objects might have different names and results, but they’re both built from the same Student class. We access their data and call their functions using the dot (.) operator, like s1.name or r1.area().
This approach makes our code cleaner and more logical. Instead of juggling loose variables and functions, we group them into meaningful units. That’s the heart of object-oriented programming: thinking in terms of objects that represent real-world things.
By the end of this experiment, you’ll see how classes and objects help us write smarter, more organized code—and how they lay the foundation for building bigger, more powerful programs.

Concepts Covered:
Defining classes with attributes and methods
Creating and using objects
Accessing data members using the dot operator
Invoking class methods to perform operations

Algorithms:

1. Calculator Class
    Input: Two integers a and b
    Process: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using class methods
    Output: Display results of all operations

2. Car Class
    Input: Car details (name, colour, year)
    Process: Assign values to object attributes
    Output: Display car information

3. Rectangle Class
    Input: Length and width
    Process: Calculate area using area() method
    Output: Display dimensions and area

4. Student Class
    Input: Student details (name, branch, subject, year, result)
    Process: Assign and display attributes
    Output: Print student information

Conclusion : In this experiment, we successfully learned how to define and use classes and objects in C++. We explored how to encapsulate data and behavior using methods, and how to manage multiple instances independently. These concepts form the foundation of object-oriented programming and are essential for building structured and scalable applications in C++.
