# Experiment-11

Aim: To understand and implement the concept of Classes and Objects in C++ through practical examples.

Software Required: Visual Studio / Code::Blocks / Dev C++ / Turbo C++, C++ Compiler (GCC or MSVC)

Theory : In C++, a class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates related variables and functions. It serves as a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of that class. Each object holds its own data and can perform operations using the class's methods. This approach is central to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which promotes modularity, reusability, and abstraction.
This experiment demonstrates how to define classes, create objects, access attributes, and use methods in C++. It introduces basic object-oriented programming through simple examples like calculators, cars, rectangles, and students.

Concepts Covered:
Defining classes with attributes and methods
Creating and using objects
Accessing data members using the dot operator
Invoking class methods to perform operations

Algorithms:

1. Calculator Class
    Input: Two integers a and b
    Process: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using class methods
    Output: Display results of all operations

2. Car Class
    Input: Car details (name, colour, year)
    Process: Assign values to object attributes
    Output: Display car information

3. Rectangle Class
    Input: Length and width
    Process: Calculate area using area() method
    Output: Display dimensions and area

4. Student Class
    Input: Student details (name, branch, subject, year, result)
    Process: Assign and display attributes
    Output: Print student information

Conclusion : In this experiment, we successfully learned how to define and use classes and objects in C++. We explored how to encapsulate data and behavior using methods, and how to manage multiple instances independently. These concepts form the foundation of object-oriented programming and are essential for building structured and scalable applications in C++.
